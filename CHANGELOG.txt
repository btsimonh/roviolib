Version 0.22 (pre)
- AWB, AEC camera control added (details thanks to Robin Vanhove)
- AWB gain levels for R,G,B channels can be individually set (details thanks to Robin Vanhove)
- for consistency AGC is now on by default (like AWB and AEC)

Version 0.2x
- forward kinematics provision (robot position in delta X,Y + rotation theta)
- provided rovio example updated to display encoders/base station info & kinematics display
- interface to wheel encoder information changed
- operation to wheel encoders fixed to be accumalative
  inside Rovio:: object itself (thanks to Phil Ryder)
- major bug in reading wheel encoders fixed (inspired by Phil Ryder)
- robot name available as Rovio->name inside robot object
- streaming video fixed and cross-platform (thanks to Rudy Anglet)
- wlan scanning added (available via custom firmware) (thanks to Rudy Anglet)
- return base station information (thanks to Rudy Anglet)
- CMake support

Version 0.15x
- streaming video interface added (see rovio_cc_lib.h)

Version 0.15
- fix to timing of waitUntilComplete() under MS Windows and bug fix for case
  when seconds > 1. (thanks to Peter Pinggera)
- fixed use of the system sleep() function for MS Windows and Linux to make
  it consistent and operate in seconds for both platforms when rovio_cc_lib.h
  is used.
- moved all the platform specific #def to the same place in rovio_cc_lib.h
- added getResoltuion() and getFramerate() (thanks to Pedro Cavestany)
- improved version of getVideo() added (thanks to Pedro Cavestany)

Version 0.14
- a very minor change to the way in which the testharness.cc code demonstrates
  and tests the turning of the robot by D degrees. The code of the library
  itself has not changed.

Version 0.13
- fixed a bug in the use of strcpy_s() in protected sendToRobot() method
  (and also getVideo()) where some of the lengths for string copy verification
  were not set correctly. This appeared to cause builds using Debug
  configuration under MS Windows VS 2008 to crash (may also effect other
  MS Windows). Did not effect Release builds under the same. Linux
  uneffected as strcpy_s() and others are MACRO replaced for non MS Windows
  platforms (see bottom of rovio_cc_lib.h). (thanks to Gabor Lovei)
- added buffer size display to verbose mode text for getImage()
- added buffer validity checks to check we get a JPEG looking buffer
  back from the robot before we attempt to decode it in getImage()

Version 0.12
- set default Night Mode frame rate to 2 so that setNightMode(true)
  actually does something useful (thanks to Greg Flitton)
- updates to README.txt + rovio_cc_lib.h (documentation only)

Version 0.11
- fixed bugs with getIRPowerState() and getIRObstacle()
- ROVIO_RESET_HOME_IF_DOCKED_ON_CLOSEDOWN set to 0 by default
- getAPIversion changed to handle "step" C++ API versions such as 0.11
- some changes to testharness.cc regarding isolation of IR testing + resolution testing

Version 0.1
- original release
