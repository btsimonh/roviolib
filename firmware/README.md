# img_spi_update__camera.bin - Custom Firmware

From Jan. 2013 the Cranfield bots use custom firmware.

This is required for some functionality (Wifi Scanning only) of RovioLib
from version 0.2 onwards.

In the spirit of open source both the firmware itself (.bin) and the src
changes (.tgz) to the original open source firmware available from the
Rovio manufacturer (via www.robocommunity.com) are detailed here.

Changes are against [original firmware source](https://github.com/jcrona/rovio-fw).
